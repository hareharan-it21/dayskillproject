<h2>HACKERS</h2>
<p>Many think that “hacker” refers to some self-taught whiz kid or rogue programmer skilled at modifying computer hardware or software so it can be used in ways outside the original developers' intent. But this is a narrow view that doesn't begin to encompass the wide range of reasons why someone turns to hacking. Is all hacking bad? Check out this video which will give you some ideas about different types of hacking. Of course, this is just scratching the surface. To learn more about the various motivations different types of hackers might have, read Under the hoodie: why money, power, and ego drive hackers to cybercrime. </p>

<h2>RUSSIA VS AMERICA</h2>
<p>Today marks two years since a watershed moment in the short but turbulent history of cybersecurity. On May 7, 2021, a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline captured headlines around the world with pictures of snaking lines of cars at gas stations across the eastern seaboard and panicked Americans filling bags with fuel, fearful of not being able to get to work or get their kids to school. This was the moment when the vulnerability of our highly connected society became a nationwide reality and a kitchen table issue.

  The good news is that since that event, the Biden-Harris Administration has made significant strides in our collective cyber defense, harnessing the full power of the U.S. government to address the full spectrum of the threat. At the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), we have been laser focused on improving resilience across our Nation’s critical infrastructure. Recognizing that organizations need a simple way to access actionable and timely cybersecurity information, we developed stopransomware.gov to provide a central location for alerts and guidance for businesses and individuals. Recognizing that only cohesive collaboration across government will scale to meet the threat, we launched the Joint Ransomware Task Force with our FBI partners to orchestrate the federal government’s response to the epidemic of ransomware. And recognizing the need to bring together industry, government, and internal partners and tear down siloes that create gaps for the adversary, we established the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC)—a concept born out of the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission on which one of us served as a Commissioner—to catalyze a community of experts on the front lines of cyber defense—from across the public and private sectors—to share insights and information in real time to understand threats and drive down risk to the nation.</p>
